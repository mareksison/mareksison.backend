## How to Run

This back-end project should be easy to run!

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Installs the necessary packages into "./node_modules."\
It also creates the "./package-lock" folder.\
It serves as a quick link to your node_modules making it more convenient to import

`--legacy-peer-deps` is a flag we use to maake installation simpler.\
It automatically installs relevant peer dependancies.\
It also adds it to you ".package.json" file.

## Running the app

### Running

$ npm run start:dev
```

Runs the app locally on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).\
IApp should already be configurated to run on port 3001.

The service will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any errors in the console.
